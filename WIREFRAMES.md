USER STORIES

When the URL is opened, an alert explaining what the game is appears, and when the User clicks OK, the game officially starts by:
1. Showing the grid where the game will be played (where the moles will appear) and showing the scoreboard (player 1 vs. player 2) and the timer for each round (which will commence when the User hits OK)
2. Moles will appear at random locations in the grid at a frequency of 2-3 seconds at a time (will tinker with that, might make it longer), and the User will use the mouse to click on spot where the mole is located at that moment.  The moles should appear, and stay visable for 2-3 seconds.  
3. When the User clicks on the mole, the event listener ('click') will call the function to score a point for the User, and to "wack" the mole.  Not sure if this will be another function, but probably will be
4.
