USER STORY

When the URL is opened, game explaination appears
-- When the User clicks the Start button, the game officially starts by:
1. Showing the grid where the game will be played (where the moles will appear) and 
	- the game board (grid) will appear in the main body of the page
2. Showing the scoreboard (player 1 vs. player 2) and
3. Showing the timer for each round (which will commence when the User hits OK)
	- both the scoreboard and timer will appear in the header
	- the timer is only for the current round for the Player 1


Moles will appear at random locations in the grid at a frequency of 1-2 seconds at a time

	-- User will use the mouse to click on spot where the mole is located at that moment.
	-- The moles should appear, and stay visable for 1-2 seconds so that User has a chance to click them ('wack them')

When the User successfully clicks on a mole in time, that player scores a point and another image of a "wacked" mole will appear in its place

If the User misses -- stretch goal is for the user to lose a point (to prevent constant random clicking all over the place). The timer (for their turn) will keep ticking away and other moles will appear for more wack attempts.  Each player will have 30 seconds to wack as many moles as possible.

When the player's time is up, the grid and round-timer will refresh for the next playerss turn

The next player will click the Start button to start their round, which will start the 30 second timer for their round-turn

When the second player's turn has ended, it will be player 1's turn again, which will start when player 1 clicks the button

This goes for 3 rounds total, and at the end of the 3rd round, whoever has the higher score (the most "hits") wins! 

STRETCH GOALS --
1. After 3 rounds, users enter a new level where
	-- the moles are quicker
	-- the grid is larger
	-- the penalty for missing a mole is you lose your turn (after 3 misses maybe)
2. Possibly give the moles new powers -- ex. if the user misses, does the mole move faster per miss, or do they get some kind
of extra powers, or maybe all of the above happen upon misses...
